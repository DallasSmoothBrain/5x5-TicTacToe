# 5x5 Tic Tac Toe

It's like regular Tic Tac Toe, except it's played on a 5x5 board and you need
4 in a row to win the game.

I wasted a lot of time playing this on paper with my friends during high school 
calculus classes

The purpose of this program was to use it to train a neural network AI opponent
that will school you every game. I wrote most of this on a plane ride and didn't
pay for onboard wifi so I couldn't search Stack Overflow to learn how to train
the network, but someday soon I'll figure it out and update this repo.

For now it's just a 2 player game to play with your friends or enemies, enjoy!
